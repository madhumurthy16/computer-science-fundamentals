Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
A: Pseudocode is an informal language that helps programmers to develop algorithms. It allows the programmer to focus on the logic of the algorithm without being distracted by the details of language syntax. It is used for brainstorming before code is written in a particular language.

2. If you run psuedocode on your computer what would happen?

A: Pseudocode is a narrative for someone who knows the requirements of a problem and is trying to learn how the solution is organized. It is meant for humans to read rather than machines, so it will not run on a computer.

Programming Assignment

Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1. Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

A: 
	INPUT first number
	INPUT second number
	IF first number is greater than second number THEN
		PRINT first number
	ELSE
		PRINT second number
	END IF

2. Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100

A: 
	INIT count to 1
	WHILE the count is less than or equal to 100 
		PRINT count
		INCREMENT count
	END WHILE

3. Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook

A: 
	FOR each entry in the phonebook
		IF current entry is the required entry
			PRINT the entry information
	END FOR

4. Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

// Implementation in JavaScript

function findEntry(phoneBook, entryNumber) {
     phoneBook.forEach(entry => {
       if(entry.id === entryNumber) {
         console.log("Name: " + entry.name + ", Phone Number: " + entry.number);
       }
       });    
}

phoneBook = [{id:1, name: 'Madhu', number: '(415)367-5067'}, 
             {id:2, name: 'Manisha', number: '(415)367-5068'}]

findEntry(phoneBook, 1);
