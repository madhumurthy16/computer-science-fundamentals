Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

# Making coffee 
FILL coffee pot with water	
PLACE the coffee pot on the coffee machine 
PLACE coffee filter inside the filter holder
ADD coffee powder
Close the coffee maker lid
TURN ON the coffee machine
IF coffee is done brewing
	POUR coffee into a mug
		IF milk needed 		// Coffee with milk
			ADD milk
			IF sugar needed
				ADD sugar
				STIR coffee
				SERVE coffee
			END IF
			ELSE 
				STIR coffee
				SERVE coffee
			END ELSE
		END IF
		ELSE IF sugar needed 	// Black coffee with sugar
			ADD sugar
			STIR coffee	
			SERVE coffee
		END ELSE IF
		ELSE
			SERVE COFFEE	 	// Black coffee
		END ELSE
END IF 	
ELSE
	Check coffee maker 
END ELSE
	
# Washing dishes

WHILE dishes in the sink
	ADD soap to cleaning sponge
	PICK UP a dish
	DO
		SCRUB the dish with the sponge 
	WHILE dish is not clean
	RINSE the dish with water
	Place the clean dish on the drying rack
END WHILE	
	
#A choice of your own. 
##Making scrambled eggs

TAKE eggs 
TAKE a bowl
WHILE there are eggs 
	CRACK the egg into the bowl
END WHILE
TAKE a whisk
DO
	WHISK the eggs in the bowl
WHILE egg mixture is not fluffy 
PLACE a skillet on the stove
TURN ON the stove
IF stove is hot
	ADD butter to pan
	ADD egg mixture to pan
	TAKE a spatula
	DO
		MIX the eggs
	WHILE eggs are not firm but soft
	TURN OFF stove
END IF
TAKE a plate
TRANSFER scrambled eggs onto the plate
Sprinkle salt and pepper
SERVE SCRAMBLED eggs

2. As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases that make them stand out?

# match.com - Online dating service
 match.com a website based on forming relationships between people uses a sophisticated algorithm known as a synapse to predict possible matches. This algorithm takes into consideration not only stated user preference but also the activity and browsing patterns of users to predict likely matches.
 #netflix - the digital streaming company
More than 80 percent of the TV shows people watch on Netflix are discovered through the platform’s recommendation system. Netflix uses machine learning and recommendation algorithms to help break viewers preconceived notions and find shows that they might not have initially chosen.

# Yelp
Yelp connects people with great local businesses through helpful and reliable reviews for the Yelp community among the millions they get. Since images are almost as vital to Yelp as user reviews, Yelp is always trying to improve how it handles image processing. Yelp uses machine learning to implement its picture classification technology. Yelp’s machine learning algorithms help the company’s human staff to compile, categorize, and label images more efficiently - no small feat when you’re dealing with tens of millions of photos.

3. Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.
An algorithm is considered efficient if its resource consumption is below some pre-defined acceptable level. An efficient algorithm should run in a reasonable amount of time on an available computer or hardware specifications. 

The two common measures are:
Time: how long does the algorithm take to complete
Space: how much working memory(typically RAM) is needed by the algorithm. This includes, the amount of memory needed by the code, and the amount of memory needed for the data on which the code operates.

For an algorithm to be efficient, the above two factors should be optimized that is,  the algorithm should fulfill all the proper requirements with minimum amount of time and within specified space limits and should not overload the memory.
