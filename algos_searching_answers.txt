Short Answer

1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A: Search for a box (containing childhood memories) in the attic.

2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A:  Looking for a book organized alphabetically (by authors name) on the library shelves. 

3: Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A: 7 iterations

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A: 3 iterations

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: Since the data collection is unsorted, linear search would be the best algorithm choice. Binary search would not work since it can only be used on sorted data collections.

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A: A binary search is the right algorithm to use on a sorted data. This is because, a binary search with its divide and conquer algorithm, divides the data collection in half every iteration, until the item is found. Whereas in a linear search we have to sequentially search, in the worst case, all million items to find the desired item.

Programming Assignment:

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

A:
var searchWord = function(dictionary,word){
  let low = 0;
  let high = dictionary.length-1;
  let count = 0;

  while(low <= high) {
    count++;
    let mid = Math.trunc((low + high)/2);
    if(word > dictionary[mid]){
      low = mid+1;
    }
    else if(word < dictionary[mid]){
      high = mid-1;
    }
    else{
      console.log("Found ",word, "in", count, "iterations.");
      return mid;
    }
  }
  return null;
};

var myDictionary = ['Abandon', 'Action', 'Albatross', 'Alive', 'Cactus', 'Daffodil', 'Education',  'Famished', 'Genius', 'happiness',  'illuminate',  'jockey',  'kangaroo',  'lantern', 'maladministration', 'nefarious', 'officious', 'parable', 'quench', 'rampart', 'sardine', 'tangible', 'ubiquitous', 'varnish', 'walkie-talkie', 'xylography', 'Zoo'];

searchWord(myDictionary, 'Albatross');

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish. 
A:
function findFish(fishTank, fish) {
  let foundFish = null, currentFish;

  for(let i = 0; i < fishTank.length-1; i++){
    currentFish = fishTank[i];
    if(currentFish === fish){
      foundFish = i;
      break;
    }
  }
  return foundFish;
};

var fishTank = ['red goldfish', 'orange goldfish', 'white-spotted goldfish', 'black-spotted goldfish', 'yellow-spotted goldfish'];

console.log("Found white-spotted gold fish at spot", findFish(fishTank, 'white-spotted goldfish'));
